# COS Assignment

This repository contains my Python program for computing U.S. federal personal income tax (2009 rates).

## File
 `cos_assignment.py` 

## How to Run
1. Open the file in Python
2. Run the program.
3. Enter filing status and taxable income when prompted.

## Example
For a single filer with taxable income of $10,000:
- First $8,350 taxed at 10% = $835
- Next $1,650 taxed at 15% = $247.50
- **Total tax = $1082.50**
